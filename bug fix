To resolve this bug, all cursor types, not just virtual record cursors, must trigger function.cursorClosed() when they're closed or disposed. Here's a conceptual breakdown of what needs to change:

1. Audit all cursor factories, especially those for:

. GROUP BY

. JOIN

. FILTER

. Aggregation-related cursors

2. Ensure that they trigger cursorClosed() on all functions they use, not just virtual functions.

3. Add this lifecycle call:

java code :

if (function instanceof FunctionWithCursorLifecycle) {
    ((FunctionWithCursorLifecycle) function).cursorClosed();
}

at the right cleanup or close stage in each cursor implementation.
